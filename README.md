# Bold Web Development Task

By: Juan Pablo Gonzalez Alvarez

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with TypeScript.
I used TailwindCSS as the styling framework.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Creates the build for this app.

### `npx serve -s build`

Runs the compiled version.

## Getting Started

You only need to run the following commands:
`npm run build`
`npx serve -s build`

## What's missing?

- Fixing filters
- Using redux to handle state
- Organize the app using layouts, not everything inside App.tsx
- Replacing 'any' types
- Fix 'Total sales' card
